# Diabetes-Disease-prediction-using-ML
DESCRPTION:
Diabetes is an illness caused because of high glucose level in a human body. Diabetes should
not be ignored if it is untreated then Diabetes may cause some major issues in a person like: heart
related problems, kidney problem, blood pressure, eye damage and it can also affect other organs of
human body. Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted earlier. To achieve this goal this project
work we will do early prediction of Diabetes in a human body or a patient for a higher accuracy
through applying, Various Machine Learning Techniques. Machine learning techniques Provide
better result for prediction by con- structing models from datasets collected from patients. In this
work we will use Machine Learning Classification and ensemble techniques on a dataset to predict
diabetes. Which is K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Forest (RF). The accuracy is
different for every model when compared to other models. The Project work gives the accurate or
higher accuracy model shows that the model is capable of predicting diabetes effectively. Stress
provides various hormones which can result in high glucose level. Which causes cancer. Stats show
that there were approximately 6.4% of adult population affected by this diabetes disease. This disease
has become normal in our day today life people does not take this seriously and avoid it. our
hypothesis was that this model would be effective in targeting high risk subjects in a very large
population for lifestyle change to reduce diabetes risk. Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing
enough insulin, or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced. Diabetes is
caused either because of pancreas not producing enough insulin or the cells of the body not
responding to the insulin produced by the body. These are the main criteria for the disease (Diabetes).
This disease Diabetes Mellitus is widely called as Diabetes. This disease is could be cured if we take
enough medication and proper diet and most importantly if it is predicted at its early stage. As this as
the core my project helps to predict the diabetes disease and helps the user to get proper medication.
